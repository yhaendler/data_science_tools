## TF-IDF score calculator

Inspired by a task that I recently did as part of a job interview, I wrote an algorithm that calculates TF-IDF score for the words that compose one or more texts. 

Although such tools exist already, my hope, besides doing some coding practice, was to get a better insight at what the TF-IDF score calculator tool does through the hands-on work of coding it from scratch. 

The texts are saved in .txt files in the _files_ folder. 

Here, just for the sake of the example, the texts are taken from (Wikipedia's English page for _Natural Language Processing_)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing].

The list of English stop-words, in the stopwords.txt file, was taken from (here)[https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords].

This is only a first version, and many things can and should be done.
